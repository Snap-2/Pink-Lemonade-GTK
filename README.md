**Pink-Lemonade-GTK** is a Gnome theme inspired by the colour scheme of a [r/unixporn post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1jnnnzv/wayfire_first_rice_far_from_complete_but_looks/#lightbox) I saw, it is a Dark theme with a tasteful amount of pink, and some really cool macOS styled window controls I've yoinked over from this really well made theme, [**Material-GTK**](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Material-GTK-Themes) made by [**Fausto-Korpsvart**](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/).

**Pink-Lemonade** is primarily and only made possible by the tools provided by [**Mint-Y-Icons**](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-y-icons) and [**Graphite-GTK**](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Graphite-gtk-theme), done fully by editing readily available presets to generate this theme.
